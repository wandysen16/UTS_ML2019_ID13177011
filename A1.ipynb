        "I choose to read Generative Adversarial Networks paper.GAN is an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm proposed in 2014 by Ian J.Goodfellow. This paper proposes a new framework for estimating generative models by using an adversarial process, by using a generative model that captures data distribution and another discriminative model that predicts the probability that a sample came from the training data.GAN is made up of two competing models which run in competition with one another and can copy and capture variants of dataset. \n",
        "\n",
        "The impression I get when I'm reading the abstract and short introduction is this framework can be used to make other training algorithms which will be applied on optimization of another algorithms. This algorithm doesn't need Markov chains for generating sample and training model. This paper will demonstrate the result of research through qualitative and quantitative evaluation through the evaluation sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper attracts me since the generative model proposed by the author can be thought of as similar to a team of criminals that try to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is similar to the one used by police, which seeks to counterfeit the fake currency. By using this concept, both teams (police and criminal) can improve their methods until the counterfeits are equal on both sides.\n",

The successes of the learning also mainly based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithm, which utilized piecewise linear units that have a well-behaved gradient. However, deep generative models did not have a significant impact since the probabilistic computations happen on likelihood estimation and related strategies, and piecewise linear units should be able to generate context.This case leads to the usage of Markov decision chain, which has a very high computational cost.\n",

GAN also increase efficiency in running the models and real-world data to be applied to the algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method is by adding two models, generator and discriminator to compete with each other. Generator model will learn the distribution of the classes while the discriminator model will learn the boundaries between both of the classes of the datasets. By doing this, the learning can be done from approximate inference between models without any sampling difficulties. In other words, the only backprop is utilized in order to get the gradients, no inference is needed during learning, and a wide variety of functions can be applied into the model. For instance, This methodology can be applied to drug research. A neural network can be applied to existing drug and suggest a new chemical structure to improve the existing drug. Another field which related to this methodology in the future is multilayer perceptron, dropout algorithm, sample generator, image manipulation, and many more."
